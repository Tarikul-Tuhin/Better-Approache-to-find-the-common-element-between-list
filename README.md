In this code, we showed two approaches to check a common item into two lists. First one is better than the second approach as the first one 
has less time complexity. 

first approach ==> O(n+m)
second approach ==> O(n*m)

array1 = ['a', 'b', 'd', 'x'];   
array2 = ['y', 'd'];          ===> return true as 'd' is common in both list


array1 = ['a', 'b', 'd', 'x'];   
array2 = ['y', 'c'];          ===> return false as nothing is common in both list


Note: Solution can be found in 'bin folder'
